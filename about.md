Hello! I am Joyce Chung. I have experience and practical skills in the Data Science field through hands-on practice and creating projects on real life datasets.

My languages are SQL and Python. I currently work on projects based on: 
- Advanced statistical modelling
- Machine learning
- Computer vision (deep learning)
  
I love collaborating with team members on meaningful projects and I enjoy working independently on tasks as well. I am a passionate learner as shown by my various side projects that have increased my knowledge and technical skills in the field of computer science. Please feel free to contact me if my skills align with any opportunities that may be available!
